# Numerical differentiation and Cauchy problem (Improved Euler's method)

The system must follow the requirements:
1. System must provide a choice of functions (f'(x)) and points for each function (through which f(x) passes) for the user.
2. System must provide the user with 2 charts: f(x) chart of the chosen f'(x) function and chart of calculated, interpolated output.
3. System must provide the user with possibility of getting two Y values (original, interpolated) out of the X value.

Program must validate data and inform the user about errors.

Interpolation is performed by Cubic splines method realized in lab 4.
